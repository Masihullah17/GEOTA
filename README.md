**Description:**<br/>

> Existing open-source coverage maps are very discrete and provide information only at densely populated locations. Moreover, different generations networks have different maps and are very difficult to interpret or analyze the information as a whole. Airtel provides their network coverage maps independent of population density and the quality 2G/3G/4G coverage signals at any given pin location in India. However, they do not provide this as raw data so as to consume for analytics and build applications on top of it by extracting insights. Therefore, we are trying to replicate the network coverage maps of Airtel with various generations of the network (2G/3G/4G) information in a single map of Sri City region and derive analytics like total area of coverage, signal quality etc...
